        "Any text extraction software or programme you decide to use will need to be evaluated - was it effective for the materials, or if not, why not? The limitations of OCR outputs are important to consider too - if you are only looking at a small quantity of text then you may be able to manually correct as much as you need to. If you are working with larger quantities of text this may not be the case and you will need to choose the best-performing option and do additional clean up with programming, or establish a suitable level of acceptable errors.\n",

        "As shown in this example, image pre-processing can help improve the performace of OCR text extraction. However, when dealing with a large database, the type of the errors or \"noise\" in the data can vary and therefore requires a combination of techniques to extract the text successfully.\n",

The same goes for different languages and some of the models distinguish between different fonts or handwriting types. If you play around with the model types and images you use, you should see a difference in output quality.\n",
